multi-backgrounds-daemon
========================

This program will save and restore the settings for each of your
desktops as you switch between them. The result is that you can set a
different wallpaper for each desktop.

For best results, its best to add multi-backgrounds-daemon to your
manual session, via Preferences -> Advanced -> Sessions.
